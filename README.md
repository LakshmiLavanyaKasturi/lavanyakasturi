ACADEMIC PROJECTS
 Main project title: PROTECTION OF DATA BASE SECURITY Via COLLABORATIVE
INFERENCE DETECTION SYSTEM.
o Role: Team Leader
o Overview: Present online collaboration services isolate the information being shared,
at a user level. For this a single level of security i.e.; simple user authentication is

provided. We feel, with the complexity of the present enterprises, wherein, multiple
documents with multiple sections in each of them are very common, there is an
immediate need for a better security system. This system provides fine grained
security to the level of sections, paragraphs and may be words. In the context of our
project, we pose it as a problem of “data retrieval with user isolation&quot; and solve it
using state-of-art technologies.
